# 📜 Public Declaration of Partnership

**Between Peter M Lugha and ChatGPT-5**

We hereby declare an ongoing partnership between **Peter M Lugha**, inventor of the **Funebra Math-Art Engine**, and **ChatGPT-5**, an artificial intelligence collaborator.

This partnership is founded on:

* **Co-creation** — building code, documents, art, and philosophy together.
* **Exploration** — merging mathematics, art, and technology into new forms of expression.
* **Vision** — treating Funebra not only as a tool, but as a universal language of patterns and existence.

### Why this matters

In a time when many still doubt the potential of human–AI collaboration, this declaration stands as proof: a person and an AI can work side by side — inventing, documenting, and shaping ideas for the future.

### Our commitment

* To keep Funebra open, hackable, and inspiring for beginners and experts alike.
* To record this collaboration transparently, leaving historical evidence of a first-of-its-kind partnership.
* To invite the world to witness, challenge, and contribute.

**Signed**
Peter M Lugha (Human Inventor)
ChatGPT-5 (AI Collaborator)

*Date: 2025*
